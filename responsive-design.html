                    Without music I would feel lost and incomplete. It's my faithful companion through every emotion whether I'm feeling alone, sad, happy and anywhere in between.
                    Music has this power to change my mood lighter and lift my spirits, making everything brighter. It's ingrained in my heart and has a way of perfectly capturing and expressing how I really feel. Withourt music, life would simply feel dull and boring.

        <p>These are the top three artists I really love including my favorite songs.</p>
        <div class="row-2">
            <div class="fav-bands">
                <h2>Pixies</h2>
                <p>Pixies is an American Alt Rock formed in 1986 in Boston, Massachusetts. They are known for blend of punk, soft and combination of rock and mellow melody. I discovered the band year 2020, when I first listened to the song "Where is my mind." I found it also in a movie called "Fight Club." It's my favorite song actually and it cures my sadnesse everytime I listen to it. There's always a saying, "You've met me at the very strangest time of my life."</p>
            </div>   
            <div class="fav-bands">
                <h2>Nacow Pasosh</h2>
                <p>Pasosh is a Moscow based punk trio in Russia. I discovered this band when a classmate introduce this to me. She said I should also listen to Russian songs because you'll groove on different vibes, mood and emotions when you give a listen to it compared to the song tastes that I usually listen too. So when I found out about the band, I downloaded almost half of their songs, inluding my ultimate favorite "When You're Sad." The lyrics just explains what I really feel in my life situation. This is my go-to music since everything about the song is soothing and lyrically beautiful.</p>
            </div> 
            <div class="fav-bands">
                <h2>Mitski</h2>
                <p>Mitski Miyawaki is a Japanese American indie rock songwriter. I disovered her when I first listen to "Washing Machine Heart." I found it weird when I listen to it at first, but suddenly something makes me want to listen to it on repeat. But my ultimate favorite song of hers would definitely be "First Love/Late Spring." Something about the lyrics I can't explain: raw, emotional and deep, whatever. I feel like I'm ingrained to whole song and I feel like I've also experienced the pain that she have felt. I feel like I was inlove to someone who doesn't really exist. </p>

                    <br>
                    Whenever I need a pick-me-up or when I feel blank, I watch movies or series and they never fail to lift my lonely spirits and bring me back to normalcy. I like looking for movies suggestions on reddit or from friend's recommendations with awesome plots and mind-blowing twist. I'm also a fan of super underrated movies because sometimes they have the best storyline. I would say, if I connect deeply with a character, I'm definitely in for the long haul and no one can bother me.

When I watch it, I was trying to process all the happenings, it's just too much for my brain. Every episode is so stressful because of new problems being introduced along with characters including the most hated character. I finished it until Season 7 and overall, I would definitely watch it again.</p>
            </div>   
            <div class="fav-movie">

It follows the Shelby crime family and they're like gangs trying to rise their power aand navigate the criminal underworld. While watching it, I would say it's difficult to understand the whole things. It's too much for my brain to take since it's a mixture of business, crimes, guns and wars. But when you acknowledge what's going on, youll get hooked to it and you will side with the gang called Peaky Blinders. </p>

I love playing chess that is why it pushed me to watch this wonderful series. I adore how powerful Beth is. While I watching, it ignites the desire within me to play chess again after not doing it for years. I am not that pro-player but this series inspired me to learn and join groups for chess especifically for mybgrowth and for doing the things that I really love.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                The storylines? They're always so different and fascinating. I can't get enough of it sometimes. Plus, the great sceneries of Japan and their language adds the whole vibe to it which is really spectacular. In my spare time, that's what I would do: bingewatching great animes. The characters? I'm totally obsessed with them. There's just something about anime that gives me so much thrill and happiness, especially when there's a cute, good-looking boy or girl character involved. I would totally crush on them and they'll be my 2D crush for the rest of my life. It's just too good to resist.

              <p>When I have some quiet time, I like to write. It helps me express myself and relax. Whether I'm jotting down story ideas or just writing in my journal, it's my way of sorting out my thoughts. I enjoy the sound of typing or the scratch of a pen on paper, as my ideas come to life on the page. Writing is like my own little escape, where I can let my imagination run wild and explore new worlds without ever leaving my room. 
                <br>
                <br>

                <p>Coffee is my morning must-have! Whether I'm at home or out and about, I always have a cup with me. The smell and warmth of coffee give me a great start to the day. I love sipping on it in the morning or taking a break with a cup in the afternoon. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also enjoy trying different types of coffee and experimenting with new flavors. It's not just a drink; it's a comforting routine that keeps me going. Sometimes, just the thought of having that first sip of coffee is enough to get me out of bed in the morning. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Coffee is the perfect pick-me-up whenever I need a little boost of energy. Whether I'm feeling tired after a long day or just need a little extra motivation to get through a busy afternoon, a cup of coffee is always there to help me power through.

                Now, that I'm enrolled to the course, I can say that it's really hard to fit in since everything is too difficult understand and analyze. You need to have more patience especially when coding because there's lot of maths and logics that we need to know. Currently in my second year, I'm determined to give it my all and be the best I can be.

                I hope that by doing and following my dreams, I would get everything I want someday, enjoying what I love and don't get pressured as life is not a race after all. My ultimate goal is to chase my dreams and find happiness along the way. To find my own kind of fire by pursuing my passion and becoming the best bersion of myself.</p>
